While using Expo CLI, I encountered an error where the development server wouldn't start, and the CLI would hang indefinitely without any error messages. This occurred after upgrading Expo CLI and installing some new packages.  The error was not present in the logs, nor did the typical troubleshooting steps (restarting the computer, deleting the `.expo` folder, etc.) resolve the issue.
